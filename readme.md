# BME498 2024-2025 Capstone Project

This repository contains the following components:

1. BME498_PCB_Design
	- This is the PCB Designed for the capstone project, interfacing an STM32F446ZET6 Microcontroller to a computer via USB and to send analog signals to MyndSearch via RCA Jacks.

2. PythonSTM32Communicator
	- This is a Python module that can be imported to another Python program in order to send data to STM32 Microcontroller via USB.

3. STM32_MyndSearch_PWM_Gen
	- This is an STM32CubeIDE Project that is used to program the Microcontroller. It handles PWM generation and duty cycle tuning.

4. CV_Protocol_Gen
	- This is a sample python program that utilizes the Microcontroller System.

5. Other Miscellaneous Folders
	- These contain files that were used during the prototyping of individual parts of the project.

Please find relevant readme.md files in each of the folders.
